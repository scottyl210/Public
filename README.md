# Minneapolis daily temperatures from 1901 - 2023:  Tmax and Tmin, plus "Tmid" = (Tmax + Tmin) / 2
# Data from 1901 to 1948 was logged at Mpls Weather Bureau downtown (44.98333, -93.3).
# Data from 1939 to 2023 was logged at from MSP Airport (44.88523, -93.23133).
# The two data sets were compared for the overlapping time of 1939 - 1948. There was a significant difference in the Tmax (higher at MSP airport) and Tmin (lower at MSP airport), 
# but these differences offset enough that there was no significant difference in Tmid between the two locations.
# So for comparisons including data before 1939, only Tmid can be used.
# Graphs and correlations are made for yearly and monthly averages, and compared with baselines of 1901 - 1960 and 1961 - 1990.
